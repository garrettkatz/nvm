# nvm
`nvm` implements a Neural Virtual Machine (NVM).  This is a neural network that emulates a symbolic machine using distributed representation and local learning.  Human-authored assembly programs for the symbolic machine can be represented and executed by the neural network.

## Requirements

`nvm` has been tested using the following environment, but it may work with other operating systems and versions.
* [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) 29
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) 2.7.15
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) 1.15.4
* [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html) 1.0.0
* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) 2.2.3
