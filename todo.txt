rank problems with to,from:
    tried a little 2x2 on paper: to1, to2, fr1, fr2.
    [h  h  h  h
     t1 t1 t2 t2   * [-1 1 1 -1].T = [0 0 0].T
     f1 f2 f1 f2]
    so actually low rank.
lork->lork (matrank_scratch.py) beats problem for load, but set+load simultaneous has problem.
    works with: set to FEF, load from FEF to FEF
    works with: set to FEF, load from FEF to devices
    works with: set to FEF, load from devices to FEF
    works with: set to DEVICES, load from FEF to FEF
    works with: set to DEVICES, load from devices to FEF
    fails with: set to DEVICES, load from FEF to devices

still need to reconcile lork-lork solution with nearly fixed points near +/- pad

lp and learn_seqs one step further
    ensure all openings *and blockages* for every k-1 to k to k+1
    for v^x and v^y, if just any one i^delta in v^y reverts to v^x, the resulting corner must be blocked by the asymptotes that become openings at v^y

show weight matrices in viz
handle activity gating outside the transition function?

competition idea: delta w_ij proportional to sum_t x_i^t W_ij^t x_j^t over recent t.  If this number is large, x_j is in agreement with others about the affect on x_i.  If it is small, x_j is in disagreement, competing.  So "more important", i.e. it's absence could be missed in the borderline cases
systematic comparison of learn rules, local and global
