make sub-routine call save register values on stack too? needs separate result register no overwritten on return pop
two assemblies could double-down program-independent linkages (e.g. reg<->reg)
empirically test attractor basins in learning rule
more encapsulated callback API for IO
bring back hypervisor + visualizer (raster and add new shape-based viewer)
cts gates, slower smoother hidden
memory management+defrag
refactor devices to registers
asymmetric time learning, and seq/lnk commands for programming learning within/between layers
instruction pitfalls:
    missing internal connectivity in nvm_net
    uninitialized internal layers in nvm_net
namespaced labels error
raise more during assembly
    sub to label that doesn't exist
normal learning in co, and single-corner sensitivity in gh (linprog?)
overall diffcounts
more biorealistic gating
    multiplicative gating is possible: mehaffy2005mult, salinas2001modulation, shepherd1985spines, koch1983nonlin
    dendritic vs somatic inhibition is multiplicative vs additive
    although, to be fair, dendritic inhibition was apical (right before entering soma, not at subsets of dendritic tree leaves)
    modulation is "divisive": higher inhibition *divides* the firing rate.  high gate output should = high inhibition.
    also intertwined with dendritic backpropagation.
namespaces for clobbered human-readable labels
different coding semantics/errors when pattern provided and token already used?
check Z that randomly interpolates X,Y and multiple intermediate Z steps
distinct excitatory/inhibitory populations
outgoing connections are all to excitatory or all to inhibitory
axons can excite either excitatory or inhibitory neurons in other regions
axons can only inhibit within region
expose gating, user-oriented library for building instructions
competition idea: delta w_ij proportional to sum_t x_i^t W_ij^t x_j^t over recent t.  If this number is large, x_j is in agreement with others about the affect on x_i.  If it is small, x_j is in disagreement, competing.  So "more important", i.e. it's absence could be missed in the borderline cases.  however, don't make *too* large, or else x_j could overrule others when it shouldn't.
