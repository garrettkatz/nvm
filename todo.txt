inspect humps that result from learn5 in seq_scratch
systematic comparison of learn rules, local and global
local approximation to linprog in learn5
use off-diagonal gating scheme (hump scaling) to "pause" activity in other regions

show weight matrices in viz
handle activity gating outside the transition function?

competition idea: delta w_ij proportional to sum_t x_i^t W_ij^t x_j^t over recent t.  If this number is large, x_j is in agreement with others about the affect on x_i.  If it is small, x_j is in disagreement, competing.  So "more important", i.e. it's absence could be missed in the borderline cases
